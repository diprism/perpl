# The PERPL Compiler

PERPL stands for Probabilistic Exact Recursive Programming Language. Unlike many general-purpose PPLs, PERPL performs exact inference, via [factor graph grammars](https://github.com/diprism/fggs).
And unlike other PPLs that do support exact inference, PERPL can express unbounded recursive calls and (with some restrictions) recursive data structures.
For example, a PCFG parser written in PERPL appears to generate (infinitely many) trees and sum the probabilities of those (exponentially many) trees that yield a given string; yet it compiles to a cubic-sized system of equations whose solution is equivalent to the CKY algorithm.

For more about the language, see [language.md](language.md).

## Building the compiler

To build the compiler (requires [GHC](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)):

    make

To run tests:

    make tests

## Using the compiler
    
To compile a PERPL program:

    ./perplc [options] FILE.ppl

Options:
        
    -O0 -O1     Optimization level (0 = off, 1 = on)
    -l          Don't linearize the file (implies -c -e)
    -e          Don't eliminate recursive datatypes (implies -c)
    -d DTYPES   Defunctionalize recursive datatypes DTYPES
    -r DTYPES   Refunctionalize recursive datatypes DTYPES
    -c          Compile only to PPL code (not to FGG)
    -z          Compute sum-product
    -o OUTFILE  Output an FGG to OUTFILE

Although `perplc` can compute sum-products, its implementation is not very efficient. The normal usage is to use the `-o` option to output an FGG to a JSON file. Then the FGG can be processed using [the `fggs` package](https://github.com/diprism/fggs).
