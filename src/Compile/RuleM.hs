   A "rule block" is a set of rules, all with the same lhs and the
   same external nodes, that comprise all the rules with that lhs.

   If there is already a rule block with this lhs, the new rule block
   is discarded. (Theoretically the new rule block is identical to the
   old one, but we do not check this.) -}
