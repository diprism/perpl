{-
Applies the following transformations:
1. ProgFun f [] (TmLam x (... tm)) (TpArr xtp (... tp))   =>   ProgFun f [(x,xtp), ...] tm tp
2. TmApp (TmApp (TmVarG x []) tm1) tm2...   =>   TmVarG x [tm1, tm2, ...]
   with partial applications η-expanded.

This transformation makes AffLin more efficient,
because we don't need to have functions like a -> b -> c
become (a -> ((b -> c) & Unit)) & Unit, only (a -> b -> c) & Unit

This also makes compilation to an FGG more efficient,
because the rule for a global function can take all its arguments at once.
